Mike discusses the confidence that faith in God can provide as we fight the battles of our lives. He also engages with the riddles found in Wisdom 10 and points out that we can now not only understand the characters, stories, and allusions of Scripture, but can recognize the fingerprints of God in the world around us and better understand the main character of Scripture: God. Today’s readings are 2 Maccabees 10, Wisdom 9-10, and Proverbs 25:4-7.\n\nWe hear every day from our community how The Bible in a Year helps to capture hearts and souls for Christ.

        "description": "📖  Follow along with the official Bible in a Year Reading Plan: https://tinyurl.com/y5jqw93s\n\nIn today’s reading from Acts, the Holy Spirit guides Peter to initiate ministry to the Gentiles, beginning with the family of Cornelius, a Roman centurion. Upon hearing Peter preach, Cornelius’ entire household receive the Holy Spirit and are baptized. Commenting on today's second reading from 1 Corinthians, Fr. Mike reminds us to pursue Christian unity and avoid the dissension and infighting we see in the Church of Corinth. Today's readings are Acts 10, 1 Corinthians 1-2, Proverbs 27:21-22. \n\nWe hear every day from our community how The Bible in a Year helps to capture hearts and souls for Christ.
